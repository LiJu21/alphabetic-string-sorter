# Alphabetical String Sorter

This TypeScript project includes two functions:

- `alphabetize`: Sort the letters in a string according to the alphabetical order.
- `customOrder`: Sort the letters in a string according to a custom alphabet.

`Since the task only requires sorting alphabetically, I did not address the order of characters other than letters.`
